# FAIRification

This github contains a number of Jupyter Notebooks that can do the following:


- Castor-to-Proto: creating a proto-Dataset
- Remapping Dataset: remaps the proto-Dataset to another datastructure (variable and value remapping)
- ListIDs: handy to replace keys
- Scramble: creates a realistic dataset but fully scrambled (even basic statistics won't work)

All the configurations of the above Jupyter Notebooks are done using an Excel.

The Excel allows to involve non-scripees to do the real heavy lifting.
