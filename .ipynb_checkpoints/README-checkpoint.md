# FAIRification

====================================================================
IMPORTANT: some updates were made and not everything is fully tested
====================================================================


This github contains a number of Jupyter Notebooks that can do the following:

- Castor-to-Proto: creating a proto-Dataset from Castor export in zip-format
- RedCap-to-Proto: creating a proto-Dataset from RedCap export in csv-format (possibly adjustments needed for non COVID19 studies)
- Remapping Dataset: remaps the proto-Dataset to another datastructure (variable and value remapping)
- ListIDs: handy to replace keys
- Scramble: creates a realistic dataset but fully scrambled (even basic statistics won't work)

All the configurations of the above Jupyter Notebooks are done using an Excel.

The Excel allows to involve non-scripees to do the real heavy lifting.


FAIRification is optimized for myDRE Workspace with a Windows VM based on OSDS-template
